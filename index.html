       Hello, my name is Stephanie Meadows. I am a passionate, determined and strong aspiring journalist and music junkie. I studied journalism and sports administration at the University of Miami. Originally from Boca Raton, Florida., my family are world travelers, we love to experience what the world has to offer. Before attending UM, I studied abroad in 2013, for two months in a town called Leiden in The Netherlands. I credit this experience as one of the best times of my life, as it really helped me discover who I am. I wrote for The Odyssey, Distraction, and the Miami Hurricane. I am extremely passionate about music and pop culture, I have an extensive knowledge of it, just ask anyone who knows me. I aspire to be in the music industry, getting an opportunity to write for a publication such as Rolling Stone Magazine. I hope to find a job that both inspires and challenges me! I put together this portfolio for you to look at some of my work and get to know me better. Enjoy!
